# Build an AI Agent with Django, LangGraph, and Permit


[Watch now on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rir9B0ZShug)

Django has the data. LangGraph coordinates the Ai Agents. Permit gives us the guardrails to ensure data is safe.

In this course, I'll take you step-by-step so you can build Ai Agents with Django, LangGraph, and Permit so you can:

✅ Save user-data with minimal overhead

✅ Talk to the data you or your users care about

✅ Integrate third-party rest API services

✅ Turn any Python functions into tools an Ai Agent can run with queries like 'what are my recent documents?' or 'What new movies are out?'

✅ Chat with Django User data through standard Django queries and without the need for vector embeddings (although you *can* use them)

✅ Easily switch LLMs to upgrade the effectiveness of your agents

✅ Leverage RBAC (role-based access control) within any Django or Python project

✅ Create a Super(visor) Agent that controls other agents

✅ Lock down access to what a User can or cannot do

✅ Add guardrails to ensure an Agent can't do anything it shouldn't (e.g. create, update, read, search, list, share, or delete any data)

✅ and more.
